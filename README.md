# Fitbit Time Series Project

### Author: Corey Solitaire

## Project Goals: 
To review 6 months of Fitbit data in order to characterize the person who wore the fitness tracker (employee or test subject status unknown) and predict the next two weeks worth of data that is missing.  

## Deliverables:
1. A jupyter notebook containing your analysis
2. A tidied data set. The source data is a little messy and there is some work that needs to be done before you can effectively work with it. Your notebook should include the code to go from the original source data to a data set that you can work with.
3. A summarization of the data, ie what can you say about the individual who was wearing this fitness tracker?
4. Predictions for the missing two weeks worth of data in a separate csv file.

## Executive Summary: 

**Project Summary:**   
The purpose to this project was to clean and explore an unlabled fitness tracker dataset, to provide evidence to support characterization of individual and use time series analysis to predict two missing weeks of tracker data.  

**Background:**   
Here at Big Research Co.Â®, we love data so much - everyone wears Fitbits, even our employees! We believe these watches are the next step in the Big Data Industry and help enhance our current research. Our research spans from fitness equiptment and drug trials to very ethical human experimentation.
However, someone in a research and develoment mixed up the labels for our Fitbit data sets and one was left out.

**Process:**   
Data set was combined from 8 csv files in Excel.  97% of food log data missing, so values were dropped.  This resulted in a data frame what was 10 columns by 225 rows, with each row representing a specific day. Data was explored and weekly trends were obsereved.  Data was applied to several time series models, with a 7-day moving average providing the lowest RMSE.  When model was applied to test it resulted in a 29% improvement over baseline (last observed value)  

**Results and Conclusions:**   
General trends in the data demonstrate a slight upward trend in calories and activity over time, with the majority of higher activity levels occuring on the weekend.  The lack of regular exercise, the lenght of time sedintary, and the the missing food data suggest this fitness tracker belongs to an employee. While the model was able to improve on baseline observations I was not able to match a model to weekly seasdonality.  There exists the possibility that alternate modeling techiniques (TSA with Prophet) would return better results however that modeling technique was not included in this study.  

**Reccomendations:**   
`Not Enough Data:` With only 7 months of data it was hard to pick up long term trends in seasonality.  More data would have yeilded better results.    
`New Model:` Spending time refining previous-cycle model and exploring prophet would improve model forcasting.    
`Cross Validation:` This model may work better on other CA counties, further investigation is necessary.
